# Prompt-to-Animation-Manim-Animator-using-LLMs
Prompt-to-Animation is an AI-powered animation generator that converts natural language descriptions into fully executable Manim Community Edition Python code. Built using LLMs like Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3.1, this tool enables creators, educators, and engineers to bring mathematical and conceptual ideas to lifeâ€”without writing code manually.


**Prompt-to-Animation** is an AI-powered animation generator that transforms natural language descriptions into fully executable [Manim Community Edition](https://docs.manim.community/) Python code. It is designed for educators, researchers, and creators who want to visually explain mathematical and scientific concepts without writing complex animation code manually.

##  Overview

This project integrates **Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3.1 model** with the **LangChain** framework to generate Manim animations directly from user prompts. It features a complete pipeline that includes:

- Prompt-based code generation  
- Manim code validation and rendering  
- Automatic video output display  
- Colab notebook integration for interactive execution  

##  Run on Google Colab

Use the project directly without any local setup:

## Working

1. **User Input**: You describe the animation in plain English.  
2. **LLM Generation**: The system uses Groq + LangChain to convert the prompt into clean, executable Manim CE Python code.  
3. **Execution**: The code is saved and rendered using Manim CLI.  
4. **Output**: The video is displayed or available for download within the notebook.  

## How to Get a Groq API Key

Follow these steps to obtain your Groq API key:

1. Go to the official [Groq platform](https://console.groq.com/playground?model=llama-3.3-70b-versatile) and sign up or log in.
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your dashboard.
3. Click **Create API Key**.
4. Copy the generated key and use it in your environment.

In your Python code (Colab or script), set the key as:

```python
import os
os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
